# How to contribute

This project started as a little excuse to exercise some of the Golang features. To make it as easy as possible for you
to contribute and for me to keep an overview, here are a few guidelines which should help us avoid all kinds of
unnecessary work or disappointment.

And of course, this document is subject to discussion, so please
[create an issue](https://github.com/vpetrigo/go-twitch-ws/issues) or a pull request if you find a way to improve it!
